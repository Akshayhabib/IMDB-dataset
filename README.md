# IMDB-dataset-having-50K-movie-reviews---Sentiment-Analysis


# Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
The first and the most important step for any NLP related task is data preprocessing. For this
question, we will try to implement a simple sentiment analysis movie review model. We will be
using the first 10,000 reviews from imdb dataset for this task. Download the dataset from kaggle and perform 
the following steps:


### 1
- Preprocess the text (i.e., the steps required prior to converting the sentence into a vector) using any library of your choice.

### 2
- Given any sentence, perform vector semantics i.e., convert the given dataset into vectors using Bag of Words approach.


### 3
-  Train a simple classifier (using Scikit-learn e.g.: SVM) to perform  sentiment analysis on the generated dataset.


### 4
- Repeat the above process again but now using word2vector. (for any sentence, take average of the vector representation of all the tokens to get the vector representation)


### 5
- Bonus: Mention the insights that you can derive from the movie reviews. (you are free to use any techniques)
